.SH NAME
Cras - The Anti-Procrastination Tool
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B cras
.RB [ \-osv ]
.RB [ \-tT 
.IR num  ]
.I file
.SH DESCRIPTION
Cras is an unapologetic daily task planner and manager for your terminal and WM
status bar. It holds your tasks only for a limited amount of time (24 hours, by
default) and doesn't allow you to edit the task list after set up, except for 
marking a task as done.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-o
Switch to short-form output.
.TP
.B \-s
Save from standard input into 
.I file.
.TP
.BI \-t " num"
Mark task 
.I num 
as done.
.TP
.BI \-T " num"
Mark task
.I num 
as pending.
.TP
.B \-v
Show version information and exit.
.SH USAGE
To set up a new task list, call Cras using the -s option. Cras will read each 
new line from standard input as a new task, until EOF is reached.

The newly created task list will be readable by Cras only up to the expiry
date, which under the default configuration is 24 hours after originally saving
it. Use -t to mark a task as done and -T to mark it back as pending.

Running Cras with no options outputs the task list. For a summary, use the -o
flag; this short-form output is suitable for printing to WM status bars.
.SH ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
Execution of Cras is affected by the following environment variables:
.TP
.B NO_COLOR
Setting it to any value disables ANSI color escapes on output.
.SH CONFIGURATION
Cras is configured by creating a custom config.h and recompiling the source 
code.
