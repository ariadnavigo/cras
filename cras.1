.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.B cras 
is an unapologetic task list manager for your terminal,
which makes task lists accessible 
only before the deadline set by the user.
.PP
To set up a new task list, call 
.B cras 
using the 
.I \-n 
option. 
.B cras 
will read each new line from standard input as a new task, 
until EOF is reached. 
.PP
By default, 
all newly created task lists have their deadline set to the current day.
Alternatively, you may set a longer deadline for a task list file by using
.I \-w
and providing a date in YYYY-MM-DD format (ISO 8601 extended.)
Past dates will not be accepted.
.PP
Use
.I \-t 
to mark a task as done and 
.I \-T 
to mark it back as pending.
.PP
Add new tasks to an already existing file using 
.IR \-a .
You may delete tasks by using the 
.I \-d 
option followed by its identifying number.
You may similarly edit the description of a task by using the 
.I \-e 
option.
When editing,
sending EOF or leaving the line blank will abort the operation.
.PP
None of the operations listed above on task list
.I file
are permitted after the deadline is due.
.PP
Running 
.B cras 
with no options will output task list
.I file
if it is not past its deadline.
